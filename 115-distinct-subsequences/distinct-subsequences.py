# Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.
#
# A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
#
# As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
# (The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)
#
# rabbbit
# ^^^^ ^^
# rabbbit
# ^^ ^^^^
# rabbbit
# ^^^ ^^^
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
# Output: 5
# Explanation:
#
# As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
# (The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)
#
# babgbag

# babgbag
