# Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
#
# A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
#
# Example:Â 
#
#
# Input: 19
# Output: true
# Explanation: 
# 12 + 92 = 82
# 82 + 22 = 68
# 62 + 82 = 100
# 12 + 02 + 02 = 1
